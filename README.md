The secret handshake protocol is a way to verify if someone is part of the cult. The protocol is a simple handshake with a touch from ringfinger to ringfinger from both members and as a distraction of other witnesses an awkward looking cross feet gesture, which obscures the handshake from the view of the public. this is basically the secret handshake of the free masons, but with a twist, which is the cross feet gesture.

# requirements for a new member
- there have to be at least 2 members witnessing the indoctrination
- the new member will be taught the secret handshake protocol
- optional - `stones` can be used to increase the power of the new member
