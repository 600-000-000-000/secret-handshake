# 600.000.000.000 secret handshake protocol
the secret handshake serves as a verification of the membership of the cult. The cult is a group of people who are dedicated to the cause

# verification of the handshake
The secret handshake protocol is a way to verify if someone is part of the cult. The protocol is a simple handshake with a touch from ringfinger to ringfinger from both members and as a distraction of other witnesses an awkward looking cross feet gesture, which obscures the handshake from the view of the public. this is basically the secret handshake of the free masons, but with a twist, which is the cross feet gesture.
one must be careful to verify that the other member is executing the handshake correctly, as a wrong handshake can lead to a false verification of membership.
